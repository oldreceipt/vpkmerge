// Build a custom soul container that is a faithful CLONE of an imported GLB.
//
// This is the library form of the `soul_import_clone` example, promoted so the
// `vpkmerge soul-container import` subcommand (and Grimoire, via the bundled
// binary) can build a soul-container override VPK from a user `.glb` with no
// terminal env-var dance. The pipeline is unchanged from the proven prototype;
// only the inputs differ: the three `SOUL_*` env vars are now explicit options.
//
// APPROACH (proven in-game): ONE clean material with an ATLASED albedo + a
// single draw call -- NOT N draw calls. Source 2 soul containers all render
// through one shader (pbr.vfx NPR toon); shipped multi-material mods differ only
// in their albedo TEXTURE. So packing every GLB material group into one atlas
// albedo (each group's UVs remapped into its atlas cell) is visually identical to
// N materials and uses the single-draw-call path confirmed to load in-game.
//
// The material is a committed clean DONOR (a shipped soul material: pbr.vfx, NPR
// toon on, NO solid outline, NO self-illum) with only g_tColor repointed to the
// atlas. Vanilla soul_container.vmat is never touched (a morphic re-emit renders
// the red error shader).
//
// PARTICLES: the orb's gold "soul" look is 3 entity-attached particles. We ship
// recolored copies (recolor_particle_bytes -> the import's dominant hue) so the
// glow matches the model instead of staying default gold.
//
// Output: fresh model + 1 material + 1 atlas texture + 3 recolored particles.

// Atlas layout, UV remapping, geometry fitting, and colour conversion convert
// between float and fixed-width integer lanes with clamped, bounded inputs; the
// truncation, sign loss, wrap, precision loss, and infallible widening on these
// casts are intentional.
