# Fixtures

Two tiers:

- **Canonical (committed):** small textures grouped by format under
  `<format>/`. Each ships with a sibling `.png` (oracle output) and
  `.meta.json` (format, dims, source SHA, tolerance). The Rust golden harness
  diffs morphic's decode against these and verifies the source SHA, so CI is
  immune to silent fixture drift.

- **Local (gitignored):** `_local/` holds the extended corpus extracted from
  the user's Deadlock install via `just bootstrap`. Used for stress testing
  before declaring a milestone done. Not in CI.

## Layout

```
fixtures/
  rgba8/                  RGBA8888 + BGRA8888 (M2)
  dxt1/                   DXT1 = BC1 (M3)
  dxt5/                   DXT5 = BC3 (M4)
  ati1n/, ati2n/          BC4, BC5 (M5)
  bc7/                    (M6)
  bc6h/                   (M7)
  rgba16f/                (M8)
  kv3/                    raw KV3 blocks + .kv3.json goldens (model exporter M1)
  meshopt/                raw MVTX/MIDX blocks + .meshopt.json goldens (M2)
  _local/                 gitignored, oracle-populated stress corpus
```

The `kv3/` tier differs from the texture tiers: each `*.kv3bin` is a raw KV3
block sliced out of a `.vmdl_c`, and its sibling `*.kv3.json` is the canonical
JSON the morphic KV3 parser is diffed against (see `tools/morphic-oracle`,
`kv3-dump`). Re-bless with `just kv3-goldens`. The committed blocks are
hornet's `DATA` (model skeleton + remap tables + LOD masks), `MDAT[0]` (the
body mesh's draw calls + scene bounds), and `CTRL` (the embedded-mesh buffer
registry: vertex/index layouts + meshopt flags).

The `material/` tier holds a full committed `.vmat_c` resource (not a sliced
block) plus a `*.material.json` golden from `morphic-oracle material-meta` (VRF's
shader name + int/float/vector/texture parameter tables). `morphic::material::parse`
is diffed against it. Re-bless with `just material-meta`.

`material/necro_hands.vmat_c` has no `*.material.json` golden; it is a **blobbed**
material (KV3 v5, LZ4, `countBlocks = 1`) used by `kv3::patch` tests to exercise
the in-place tint-double recolor that keeps a blob section compressed (see
`docs/spike-blobbed-vmat-recolor.md`). `material/necro_picker_hand_effect.vmat_c`
is a **two-blob** material (`countBlocks = 2`, its `m_dynamicParams` expressions)
that regresses the blob-frame reader's one-frame-per-blob path.
`material/picker_hand_glow.vmat_c` has a **neutral white** `g_vColorTint` stored as
tagless `DOUBLE_ONE`s, exercising the recolor's re-encode promotion path. Neither
has a `*.material.json` golden.

`kv3/hornet_model_meta.json` is a higher-level golden (not a raw block): the
compact model summary the M3 mesh/skeleton decoder is diffed against, produced
by `morphic-oracle model-meta`. It holds the sorted bone-name set, per-LOD0-mesh
vertex layouts + draw calls + materials + scene bounds, the vertex/index totals,
and a source-space position bbox. The committed `model::tests` reproduce the
buffer-free parts of it from the `DATA`/`CTRL`/`MDAT[0]` blocks above; the gated
`tests/model_local.rs` reproduces the whole thing from a real VPK. Re-bless with
`just model-meta`.

The `meshopt/` tier holds raw `*.meshopt` MVTX/MIDX payloads sliced from
hornet's embedded meshes, each with a sibling `*.meshopt.json` golden
(decoded length + SHA-256 from VRF). The morphic meshopt decoders are diffed
byte-for-byte against these. Committed fixtures span vertex strides 52/56/60
and both index buffers. Re-bless with `just mesh-buffers`.

## Copyright

The committed canonical corpus is intentionally tiny so it serves as a
regression test, not redistribution. Where possible, prefer hand-authored
synthetic textures (gradient, checker, alpha edge) over game assets. The
extended `_local/` corpus is per-user and never leaves the developer's
machine.
