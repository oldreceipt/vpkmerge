# Custom animation authoring pipeline (end-state design)

Design note for the eventual "hand-author a Deadlock animation in Blender and play
it in-game" workflow. Captures where we are, the end-state UX, the engineering
still missing, and the constraints. Context: the quantized-pose codec for
`.vnmclip_c` is done and **in-game confirmed** (see
[handoff-nm-loose-clip-pose.md](handoff-nm-loose-clip-pose.md) and the NM section
of [../CLAUDE.md](../CLAUDE.md)); everything so far edits *existing* compiled clips
programmatically. This doc is the plan for true hand-authoring.

## Two layers

1. **Authoring (artist tools).** Blender or Maya: pose the rig, keyframe, IK, see
   the mesh deform. Produces a *source* animation.
2. **Compiled engine files.** Source 2's compiler (ModelDoc / resourcecompiler)
   turns that source into the compiled `.vnmclip_c` / `.vnmgraph_c`. This is the
   layer morphic reads and writes.

All work to date lives in layer 2 (decode the compiled quantized stream, transform
it, re-encode). Great for *derived* edits (amplify, spin, overlay, retime); not how
you key a dance from scratch, and limited to channels the clip already animates.

## The official pipeline (informational)

```
Blender/Maya -> FBX or DMX -> Source 2 ModelDoc -> resourcecompiler -> .vnmclip_c + graph
```

Deadlock has **no official modding/animation SDK released** (as of this work), so
this path isn't available to mods. And even with it, the animation graph resolves
clips by **compile-baked references** — late-added files at new paths are ignored
(proven; see the handoff doc's round 4). So a new clip can only enter the game by
**replacing an existing referenced clip at its path** — the same override mechanism
we already use. The SDK would only change *how the bytes are authored*, not *how
they get into the game*.

## End-state workflow (SDK-free, the target)

```
Blender (key against the exported skeleton)
  -> glTF
  -> morphic importer (sample per-frame per-bone, map by bone name)
  -> NmClip -> encode_compressed_pose
  -> write the compressed-pose section into the .vnmclip_c
  -> pack at the slot's path -> addon VPK
```

Artist's view, three commands:

1. **Export the rig to author against** (already built):
   ```
   vpkmerge anim export --hero yamato --slot reload_idle --out yamato_reload.glb
   ```
   A skinned, animated GLB: real mesh, real skeleton, the existing clip as
   reference. (`morphic::model::{decode, nm_clip_to_clip, to_glb}` +
   `examples/nm_clip_preview_glb.rs` do this today.)

2. **Animate in Blender.** Keyframe the armature. One rule: do not rename or
   reorder bones (mapping is by bone name). Export glTF with the animation.

3. **Import + pack** (built 2026-06-14, as `examples/nm_clip_import_glb.rs`):
   ```
   cargo run --release -p vpkmerge-core --example nm_clip_import_glb -- \
       pak01_dir.vpk \
       models/heroes_wip/yamato/clips/reload_idle_quick.vnmclip_c my_taunt.glb \
       taunt_dir.vpk \
       models/heroes_wip/yamato/clips/reload_idle.vnmclip_c \
       --mesh models/heroes_staging/yamato_v2/yamato.vmdl_c --preview taunt_preview.glb
   ```
   Reads the slot's clip + its `.vnmskel_c`, imports the glTF animation onto it
   (`morphic::model::import_glb_onto_nm_clip`, v5 in-place), and packs the result at
   the slot path(s) into an addon VPK. The optional `--mesh`/`--preview` writes a
   playable GLB to eyeball the imported motion first. (A first-class `vpkmerge anim
   import` CLI subcommand is the eventual Grimoire-facing wrapper around the same
   core call.)

Then install in `game/citadel/addons/` (or let Grimoire number it) and trigger the
slot in-game.

## Built vs. missing

**Built and proven:** the quantizer (`encode_compressed_pose`), the byte-faithful
blob splice (`patch_kv3_resource_blob`), glTF export + preview (`nm_clip_to_clip`,
`to_glb`), and in-game acceptance of re-encoded clips (single-hue, bow, spin,
moonwalk, slow-mo all confirmed). The codec round-trips (decode -> encode -> decode
pose-identical, 90%+ byte-exact).

**Arbitrary-length blob write — DONE (2026-06-14).** `replace_blob_v5` (via
`kv3::set_sole_blob` / `morphic::patch_kv3_resource_sole_blob`) writes a pose blob
of any length up to one LZ4 frame (16 KB; ~70 frames of 29 channels, more for
fewer), updating `sizeBlobs`/`comp2`/`comp_total` + the per-blob length + the
frame-size table. Staying within one frame keeps buf2's uncompressed size fixed, so
no document-array reshaping. CI: `sole_blob_resize_round_trips`. `set_scalars` and
`set_bools` gained the blobbed-LZ4-v5 branch (decompress-working + reassemble) they
were missing, so offsets and flags can be patched on a clip.

**Encoder v1 — DONE, IN-GAME CONFIRMED (2026-06-14).**
`morphic::model::reencode_nm_clip(original, &NmClip)` re-encodes a clip with a
**changed animated-rotation channel set at a fixed frame count**: rotation tracks
may be added (a static bone becomes animated) and re-posed; it splices the (now
longer/shorter) stream, rewrites the per-frame offsets, and flips each
newly-animated bone's `m_bIsRotationStatic`. CI: `reencode_adds_a_rotation_channel`.
Verified in-engine: a re-encode that converted all 68 static rotation tracks of
Yamato's `reload_idle_quick` to animated loaded and played (whole upper body
wobbled). The container fix that unblocked it: a blobbed KV3 block has a second
`0xFFEEDD00` trailer after the compressed blob frames that the engine asserts on
(morphic's reader ignores it); `replace_blob_v5` now re-appends it. Validated
offline against VRF/Source2Viewer (the engine-grade KV3 reader) before in-game.

**Bone masks are a real constraint.** Only the **upper body** moved in that test:
the animgraph blends `reload_idle_quick` over an upper-body bone mask, so authored
leg/lower-body channels are discarded for that slot even though the clip carries
them. Pick the slot by which bones it un-masks: a full-body idle (e.g.
`hideout_stand_idle`) for whole-body motion, an upper-body slot for arm/torso work.

**IN-GAME RESULT (2026-06-14): the v4 full re-encode is ENGINE-INERT.** A clip
re-encoded via `encode_kv3_resource` (uncompressed v4) loads with no KV3 error and
opens in Source2Viewer, but the engine's NM animation runtime does **not** read its
pose data -- it does not animate, even for channels the clip already animates
(tested: a v4-re-encoded reload that animated via the v5 path showed nothing; a
from-scratch idle showed nothing). NM clips ship v5; downgrading to v4 makes the
pose blob invisible to the animation system. **Only the v5 byte-faithful in-place
path animates in-game** (`patch_kv3_resource_blob` / `set_*`, LZ4 preserved -- the
bow/spin/moonwalk/slow-mo effects). So `reencode_nm_clip_full` is an **offline-only**
tool (round-trip tests, GLB preview, S2V) until morphic gains a **v5 KV3 writer**;
the gaps it "closes" (translation/scale adds, frame-count change, from-scratch) are
NOT yet achievable in-game. To deliver them in-game: write a v5 encoder (two-buffer
+ LZ4 frames) so a full re-encode stays v5, or do the structural edits surgically in
the v5 container. Separately, whether the engine even reads *added* channels (vs a
compile-baked channel set) is still open -- the reload add test was confounded by
the slot's upper-body bone mask.

**Full encoder (offline only) -- DONE (CI; NOT engine-viable, see above).**
`morphic::model::reencode_nm_clip_full(original, &NmClip)` closes both remaining
gaps by **rebuilding the whole DATA block from the value tree** (uncompressed v4 via
`encode_kv3_resource`) instead of patching in place. Each former blocker becomes a
plain tree edit: adding a **translation/scale channel** (its range is recomputed
from the channel's min/max and written as a real value -- the writer re-tags
everything, so no tagless-constant problem) and changing the **frame count** (the
`m_compressedPoseOffsets` array is rebuilt and `m_nNumFrames` set). It recomputes
every animated channel's range from data, so untouched channels re-quantize within a
sub-step (use the in-place `reencode_nm_clip` when byte-faithfulness matters). CI:
`full_reencode_adds_a_translation_channel`, `full_reencode_changes_frame_count`,
`full_v4_reencode_round_trips`. The identity v4 re-encode opens cleanly in
Source2Viewer (VRF); an *edited* v4 re-encode still needs an in-game confirmation
(v4-uncompressed clips are new in-engine territory; the v5 surgical path is already
confirmed).

So the encoder is feature-complete for the importer:
- **Resampling to the slot's clock** is now free either way -- match the frame count
  (in-place) or change it (full re-encode).
- **Engine timing** is clip-duration-driven (confirmed via the Warden slow-mo test),
  so a resampled clip plays at the slot's duration.

## De-risking order

The full clip encoder landed first (`reencode_nm_clip` in-place + the offline
`reencode_nm_clip_full`), proven byte-/pose-faithfully on the committed fixtures and
across a full pak (`tests/nm_clip.rs`, `tests/nm_clip_local.rs`).

**Blender importer -- DONE (2026-06-14).** `morphic::model::gltf_import` is the thin
layer the encoder made possible: read a `.glb`'s animation back into per-bone-name
TRS tracks (`read_glb_animation`, on the `gltf` reader crate), time-stretch them onto
the slot's frame grid mapping bones by name (`apply_animation`), and splice via the
v5 in-place `reencode_nm_clip` (`import_glb_onto_nm_clip`). It honors the in-place
limits: rotations may be edited or **added**, translation/scale are edited only where
the slot already animates them. CI (`tests/gltf_anim_roundtrip.rs`):
`glb_writer_reader_round_trip` proves the writer/reader contract (author a skeleton +
clip, `to_glb`, read it back, every TRS channel survives keyed by bone name), and
`apply_animation_maps_by_name_and_respects_constraints` proves the map-and-edit logic
against a real fixture clip. End-to-end pack: `examples/nm_clip_import_glb.rs`. Still
offline-untested in-game on a *hand-keyed Blender* `.glb` specifically (the underlying
v5 in-place re-encode is in-game confirmed; the new piece is just the glTF read).

## Grimoire integration (eventual)

Folds into the mod manager: pick a hero + slot, drop a `.glb`, and it shows the clip
**animating on the actual hero mesh in-browser** (three.js — why the GLB export and
the IBL/cubemap work matter) before committing; a cheap spring-sim on the cloth/hair
bones papers over the runtime-sim gap so the preview reads right; one click installs.
Same morphic core behind the CLI and Grimoire. Trust story: author visually, preview
on the real mesh, and the round-trip guarantee means what you preview is what ships.

## Constraints (hold regardless of tool)

- **Replace-only** — overwrite an existing slot; cannot register a new animation.
- **Same skeleton** — no cross-hero retarget without a bone retargeter (heroes have
  unique rigs, 98-126 bones).
- **Match the slot's additive type** — additive deltas and absolute poses are not
  interchangeable.
- **Cloth/hair bones are runtime-simulated**, never in clips, so they won't follow an
  authored pose (preview dodge: spring-sim them in three.js).
- **Online**: the server animates vanilla, so own-hero / cosmetic surfaces only.
